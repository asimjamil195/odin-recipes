<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
  <li>
    Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
    heat until well browned.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with
    sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning,
    fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring
    occasionally.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
    boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
    parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  </li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>
    To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
    baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
    slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
    mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and
    sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover
    with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make
    sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
    additional 25 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
